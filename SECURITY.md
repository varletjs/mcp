## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow security guidelines in documentation
3. **Environment Variables**: Protect sensitive environment variables
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS when possible
5. **Access Control**: Limit access to MCP server endpoints

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in CI/CD

## 🔍 Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for API calls
- **Secure Defaults**: Secure configuration defaults
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

### Planned Security Enhancements

- **Authentication**: Optional authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Audit Logging**: Security event logging
- **Encryption**: Data encryption at rest and in transit

## 🚫 Security Considerations

### Known Limitations

1. **Local Execution**: MCP server runs with local user permissions
2. **File System Access**: Server can access local file system
3. **Network Requests**: Server makes external API requests
4. **Environment Variables**: Server reads environment variables

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Run with minimal required permissions
2. **Network Isolation**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor server activity and logs
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep server and dependencies updated
